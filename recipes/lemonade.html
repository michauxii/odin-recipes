        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In the 1800's this is how people made lemonadeâ€”you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Lemons</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Cups White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Quarts Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
            <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
        </ol>
